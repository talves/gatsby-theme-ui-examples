# gatsby-theme-ui-examples

Using [`theme-ui`](https://github.com/system-ui/theme-ui)

WARNING: This repository is not being maintained in public. Please understand, this is a POC repository for review only. At a later time, there may be a follow up to this repository with production ready themes. Expecting these themes to work going forward is not guaranteed.

-------------------------

## Overview

This repository is **NOT** trying to solve all the things. It is taking the idea of Gatsby themes and researching a way to structure them in a way that helps us to build upon our themes with as little forward work as possible. This repository will concentrate on composing the themes using `theme-ui`. At the least, it should spawn some discussion. At the most, it will give a jumping pad for your own ideas.

## Tags

There are some pre tags that will show you the state of master prior to the branch merge. (pre-01, pre-02, etc)

**_Reminder:_** You can do a git checkout of a tag, although this puts your repository in “detached HEAD” state, which has some ill side effects if you try to make changes.

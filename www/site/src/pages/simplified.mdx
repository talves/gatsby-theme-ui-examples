In the simple theme setup we combine our layout at the site level, but there is a missing shared layout. We will address these concerns in future steps of our tutorial example. Most of this code was 

### Setup

Create a yarn workspaces monorepo with `/www/*` and `/packages/*` as your workspace directories.

Create the `site` in `/www/site/` and setup your new Gatsby site. Add some simple theme plugins using the packages here.

We setup two themes (`gatsby-theme-a` and `gatsby-theme-b`) and will use a parent theme `gatsby-theme-style-guide` to show the theme each targets.

Here is our `gatsby-config.js` file:
```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    'gatsby-plugin-mdx',
    {
      resolve: '@talves/gatsby-theme-a',
      options: {
        name: 'gatsby-theme-a',
        basePath: '/a',
        returnPath: '/',
      },
    },
    {
      resolve: '@talves/gatsby-theme-b',
      options: {
        name: 'gatsby-theme-b',
        basePath: '/b',
        returnPath: '/',
      },
    },
  ],
};
```

### Paths in the plugins as options

Passing the route paths into the themes allows us to pass the options down to the parent theme `@talves/gatsby-theme-style-guide`. Our themes import and pass down their own theme import, but we will be changing that later in our progression of restructuring out theme architecture.

```js
// gatsby-config.js
const theme = require('@theme-ui/preset-deep');

module.exports = options => {
  const {
    name = '@talves/gatsby-theme-a',
    returnPath = '/a',
    basePath = '/a',
  } = options;
  return {
    plugins: [
      {
        resolve: `@talves/gatsby-theme-style-guide`,
        options: {
          theme,
          basePath,
          returnPath,
        },
      },
    ],
  };
};
```

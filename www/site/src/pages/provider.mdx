Gatsby theme for adding shadowable theme provider to multiple Gatsby themes for composition.

Now time to remove the provider and make it a theme plugin. This will make our themes opinionated and allow all of our theme plugins to use this same plugin knowing they will have the same provider and only the main site will need to wrap the root element to be used by all the plugins.

### The site theme plugin package

Create a package `@talves/gatsby-theme-site-provider` 

### Setup the theme provider plugin

Move the two (2) config files to the package root: `gatsby-browser.js` and `gatsby-ssr.js`

Move `/src/provider.js` to same location in the package.

Create an empty components and default theme export to be able to shadow.

Now we are ready to create a more dynamic `wrapRootElement` in our provider to allow a flag whether to wrap the root element or not. Typically only the site will need to be wrapped. Most plugins will just default to the site provider.

### Setting up the provider in the site.

```sh
yarn add @talves/gatsby-theme-site-provider
```

In your theme, import and export the provider exports in src/provider.js.

```js
// example provider.js
export * from '@talves/gatsby-theme-site-provider'
```

Wrap our theme in an isolated provider, but make sure we pass along the consumers preference to wrapRootElement with the default provider.

```js
// gatsby-config.js
module.exports = options => {
  const wrapRootElement = options && options.wrapRootElement;
  return {
    plugins: [
      {
        resolve: `@talves/gatsby-theme-site-provider`,
        options: {
          wrapRootElement,
        },
      },
    ],
  };
};
```

If you want to use a different theme for all the themes using `@talves/gatsby-theme-site-provider` then shadow the themes/index.js file in this plugin.

```js
// src/@talves/gatsby-theme-site-provider/themes/index.js
export { default } from '@theme-ui/preset-swiss'
```

To shadow the provider you should add this plugin to your main site, then shadow it using the path below from your own provider. This is **ONLY** needed of you have some special setup that will extend the provider for all the themes.

```js
// src/@talves/gatsby-theme-site-provider/provider.js
export * from '../../provider'
```

End-users of a theme that is built with `gatsby-theme-site-provider` can shadow the same provider.js in the theme to use the theme context of the site. Make sure to flag `wrapRootElement: false` in options for all themes then `wrapRootElement: true` for the site to use the same provider. We will be providing an example of this in the next steps.

# <OutsideLink to={Link04}>04 - Page Layout Theme Plugin</OutsideLink>

The site layout plugin here is a shell to be used by other themes. The site will shadow a Layout component to be used to wrap all pages. This allows for consistent composition of the page components and will not get in the way of theming a page. Taken and inspired originally by the `theme-ui` plugin.

### The site theme layout plugin

Create a new package called `@talves/gatsby-theme-site-layout`.


### Shadowing your layout to the plugin from your Gatsby site

We will showdow the exports of out layout component to a named export (`Layout`). The `Layout` component will be imported by the themes for use to wrap pages. If the component is not shadowed, it will just use the default empty component wrapper.

Shadowing the component is as easy as creating the file in the path below. This is just an example layout, but gives you a solid idea of how this is accomplished.

```js
// src/@talves/gatsby-theme-site-layout/layout.js
export { Layout } from '../../components/Layouts';
```

### Setting up the layout plugin in your theme

In your theme, import and use the Layout component, which does not include any default layout.

```jsx
// example page template
import { Layout } from '@talves/gatsby-theme-site-layout'

export default props =>
  <Layout {...props}>
    {/* your theme content goes here */}
  </Layout>
```

End-users of a theme that is built with `gatsby-theme-ui-layout` can shadow the same Layout component to customize the page layout.

### Our test theme plugin using the layout

We are going to create a plugin for testing (`@talves/gatsby-theme-test`) the layout plugin shadowing.

The test plugin will also be using the `@talves/gatsby-theme-site-provider`. 
See `gatsby-config.js`:
```js
module.exports = options => {
  const wrapRootElement = options && options.wrapRootElement;
  return {
    plugins: [
      `gatsby-plugin-mdx`,
      `@talves/gatsby-theme-site-layout`,
      {
        resolve: `@talves/gatsby-theme-site-provider`,
        options: {
          wrapRootElement,
        },
      },
    ],
  };
};
```

Add the theme into our main site and setup the `gatsby-config.js` to use it.

```js
// www/site/gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    ...
    {
      resolve: `@talves/gatsby-theme-test`,
      options: { wrapRootElement: false },
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

We now have a test page setup, so the next step is to shadow the Layout to use the sites layout. Add the shadow component to the path in our site:

```js
// src/@talves/gatsby-theme-site-layout/layout.js
export { Layout } from '../../components/Layouts';
```
